Absolutely — here's a **detailed content guide + study plan** to help you **learn how to decompose a monolithic app into microservices** step by step. This is great if you're preparing for a migration project, a tech lead role, or just want to level up.

# 🧠 Microservices Decomposition Study Plan  
**Goal:** Decompose a monolithic Node.js app into scalable, loosely-coupled microservices.

---

## 🗓️ **4-Week Study Plan**

> ✅ *Time Required: 5–10 hours per week*

---

### ✅ **Week 1: Fundamentals + Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

#### 🔍 Topics to Learn:
- What are Microservices?
- Pros & Cons of Microservices vs Monolith
- Overview of Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Bounded Contexts & Ubiquitous Language
- Identifying Domain Models

#### 📚 Resources:
- Book: *Domain-Driven Design Distilled* by Vaughn Vernon (short + excellent)
- Video: [Microservices Explained - TechWorld with Nana (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc)
- Article: Martin Fowler – [Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

#### 🛠 Practice:
- Choose a monolithic project (or build a small one with users, products, and orders)
- Draw the domain model
- Identify bounded contexts (e.g., Auth, User, Product, Orders)

---

### ✅ **Week 2: Service Decomposition + Communication**

#### 🔍 Topics to Learn:
- Patterns for decomposing a monolith
- Strangler Fig Pattern
- Synchronous (REST/gRPC) vs Asynchronous (event/message-driven)
- API Gateway basics

#### 📚 Resources:
- Article: [Strangler Fig Pattern – Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)
- Video: [Event-Driven Microservices - TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)

#### 🛠 Practice:
- Define clear service boundaries
- Create a microservice architecture diagram
- Prototype API contracts (Swagger or Postman Collections)

---

### ✅ **Week 3: Code + Database Separation**

#### 🔍 Topics to Learn:
- Service-specific database per microservice (important!)
- No shared schema — design for autonomy
- Data duplication strategies
- Data consistency (eventual consistency, compensation)

#### 📚 Resources:
- Article: [Database per Service – Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html)
- Video: [Microservices Architecture – Full Course (freeCodeCamp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wD4s9phRBY)

#### 🛠 Practice:
- Break one service from your monolith (e.g., Auth or Product)
- Give it its own DB (e.g., Mongo/Postgres container)
- Make it communicate with other services via API or message queue

---

### ✅ **Week 4: Deployment, DevOps & Observability**

#### 🔍 Topics to Learn:
- Dockerize microservices
- Use Kubernetes or Docker Compose
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab, or CircleCI)
- Add monitoring/logging (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- Secure service-to-service communication (JWT, mTLS)

#### 📚 Resources:
- YouTube: [Dockerizing Node.js Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE)
- Article: [12-Factor App Principles](https://12factor.net/)
- Tool: [Nx for Monorepo Management](https://nx.dev)

#### 🛠 Practice:
- Dockerize 2-3 services
- Run them with Docker Compose
- Add NGINX or API Gateway for routing
- Set up basic logging/monitoring

---

## 🧩 Final Project (Week 5+)
> **Build a Mini App Using Microservices**

**Example:** E-Commerce app with:
- Auth Service (JWT-based)
- User Service
- Product Service
- Order Service
- Email/Notification Service

Use:
- **Node.js + Express/Fastify**
- **MongoDB or Postgres per service**
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka** for async events
- **Docker Compose** for local dev
- **Swagger** for API docs
- **API Gateway** for entry point

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips:
- Use **Nx, Turborepo, or Lerna** for monorepos
- Explore **event sourcing** and **CQRS** for advanced architectures
- Use **OpenTelemetry** for tracing distributed services
