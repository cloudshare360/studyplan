Absolutely! Let’s **dive deep into Week 1** — the foundation of your microservices journey. This is all about understanding the **"why"** and **"how"** of microservices, and learning how to break your app logically using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.

# 🧱 Week 1: Fundamentals & Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

---

## 🎯 **Goals for the Week**
- Understand what microservices are and why they matter
- Learn key differences from monoliths
- Get familiar with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Identify potential **bounded contexts** in your app
- Draw a domain model of a real or mock app

---

## 📚 Topics & Breakdown

### 🔹 Day 1: What are Microservices?

#### ✅ Learn:
- Microservices are small, independent services that run and deploy separately.
- Each service focuses on a **single business capability**.
- They communicate via **APIs or events**.

#### ✅ Key Traits:
- **Decentralized data** (no shared DB)
- **Independent deployments**
- **Resilient & scalable**
- Language-agnostic (but we’ll focus on Node.js here)

#### ✅ Study Material:
- [Martin Fowler: Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
- [YouTube: Microservices Explained (Nana)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc)

### 🔹 Day 2: Microservices vs Monolith

#### ✅ Understand:
| Feature | Monolith | Microservices |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Codebase | Single | Multiple |
| Deployment | One unit | Independent |
| Scalability | Whole app | Per service |
| Failure | Affects entire app | Isolated |
| Tech Stack | Same | Can differ |

#### ✅ Exercise:
- Write pros/cons of each based on your own (or imagined) project.
- Reflect on where a monolith *hurts* you: deployment time? team size? scalability?

### 🔹 Day 3: Intro to Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### ✅ Learn:
- DDD is a method to **model software around business domains**.
- It helps you figure out how to **split your app logically**.
  
#### ✅ Core Concepts:
- **Domain**: The business problem space
- **Entity**: Object with identity (e.g., `User`, `Product`)
- **Value Object**: No identity, just value (e.g., `Address`)
- **Aggregate**: A group of entities that change together
- **Bounded Context**: A logical boundary around a model

#### ✅ Study:
- Book: *Domain-Driven Design Distilled* (easy read, 100 pages)
- [DDD Cheat Sheet (PDF)](https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/reference/)

---

### 🔹 Day 4: Identify Bounded Contexts

#### ✅ Task:
- Choose a real or mock project. E.g., a food delivery app.
- List business areas like:
  - Authentication
  - Users
  - Restaurants
  - Orders
  - Payments
  - Delivery

Each becomes a **candidate microservice**.

#### ✅ Tools:
- Use diagrams.net or Whimsical to draw your **domain map**
- You can also sketch it on paper, no shame in the analog game 📝

---

### 🔹 Day 5: Model Your Domain

#### ✅ Create:
- A diagram of your app’s **domain entities** and how they relate
- Show which **bounded context** owns each entity

#### ✅ Example:
```text
[User Context]
 - User
 - Profile
 - Address

[Order Context]
 - Order
 - OrderItem

[Payment Context]
 - Invoice
 - PaymentMethod
```

Now ask:
- Who "owns" `User` data?
- Can `Order` work without knowing `User` details directly?

---

### 🔹 Day 6–7: Reflect + Recap

- Review all the material
- Polish your domain map
- Post your domain design to a blog or share with friends for feedback
- Optional: start turning each bounded context into its own folder/repo structure

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways by End of Week 1
- You understand what microservices are and when to use them
- You know how to analyze your app from a **business logic perspective**
- You’ve drawn a domain model and bounded contexts for your app
- You’re ready to decompose one service at a time

---

## ✅ Deliverables (Optional Homework)
- Domain Model Diagram (e.g., PNG or draw.io link)
- List of Services with short descriptions
- Pros/Cons comparison of monolith vs microservices in your context
